## Abstract

The avid bird watcher faces a classification problem every single time they find their way into the field: to determine bird species. The goal of this paper is to give a sketch for a deep learning architecture which could be the core of a potential bird identification application. Therefore we compare four different Convolutional Neural Network approaches for building a classifier from scratch: a baseline model; an augmented baseline model; and two types of pretrained networks.
